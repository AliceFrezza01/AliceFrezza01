Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a final-year Computer Science student (with a specialization in Software Engineering) at the Free University of Bolzano, Italy.

Through my education, I have gained strong skills in various programming languages, especially Java and C. I have also gained experience with popular mobile development frameworks, such as React Native. Have a look at Stickerest as an example! Furthermore I have experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Typescript.

I am a quick learner and enjoy exploring new technologies and tools. I have experience working on both individual and team projects, allowing me to develop my communication and collaboration skills. 

In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with hardware and playing chess.
